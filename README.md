# LIRI-Bot

### Overview

This LIRI Bot application is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface application designed for the UMN Coding Bootcamp's homework assignment by Ian Gacek. It is a command line application that will provide data from 3 different APIs - Spotify, OMDB, and BandsInTown.

### Organization

This LIRI application primarily functions from the `liri.js` file, with three different functions being contained in the file.

## Instructions

If the function above does not work, run the following four commands:
